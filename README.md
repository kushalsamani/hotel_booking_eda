# Hotel Booking EDA Project



This project explores hotel booking patterns using six interrelated datasets. The goal is to uncover trends, seasonal behaviors, revenue insights, and booking patterns to help hotel operators make data-driven decisions.

## EDA Performed



- Missing value treatment (e.g., capacity filled using mean)

- Data type standardization (e.g., date parsing)

- Handling mismatches (e.g., bookings > capacity)

- Exploratory visualizations:

- Revenue trends by month

- City-wise and platform-wise revenue

- Booking status distribution

- Ratings vs revenue

- Room category popularity

- Weekend vs weekday comparison

- Heatmaps (City Ã— Month revenue)

## Future Improvements



- Add predictive modeling (e.g., cancellation prediction)

- Merge August data and rerun time-series analyses

- Deploy key metrics using a dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or PowerBI)
